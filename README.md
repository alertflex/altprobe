The repository includes Alertflex collector and installation scripts for security sensors (Suricata NIDS, Wazuh HIDS, Falco CRS). 

Alertflex collector (Altprobe) is an open-source element of the Alertflex project. Alertflex works as a security event manager and implements CTI, EDR, NTA and SOAR technology stack based on integration with third-party cybersecurity products (more than 20 are integrated at the moment).
