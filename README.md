The repository includes Alertflex collector and installation scripts for security sensors (Suricata NIDS, Wazuh HIDS, Falco CRS). 

Alertflex is a SecOps (Security Operations) solution that helps assemble processes and technology to deal with IT security risks, threats, and issues.

The solution works as a Security Event Manager with SOAR functionality for a distributed grid of security sensors and scanners. At this moment Alertflex provides an orchestrator and a single user interface for more than 20 products. Integrated products are mostly free open-source software in the areas of IDS and DevSecOps, that can be unified by Alertflex into one or several projects.
