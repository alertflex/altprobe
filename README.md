The repository contains the source code for Alertflex Collector/Runner, also known as Altprobe, as well as installation scripts for Altprobe, cyber security sensors, and scanners.

The Alertflex project is a tool that helps manage the security of software development and operations (DevSecOps) by orchestrating various functions like application security, posture management, and workload protection. The project combines popular free and open source software to create a distributed solution for hybrid cloud infrastructure.

Alertflex has a key feature which is the support for the full DevSecOps cycle. It is capable of performing not only vulnerability/misconfiguration scanning tasks (DAST, SAST, SCA), but also excels in continuous monitoring by aggregating and forwarding cybersecurity events from open source sensors (HIDS, NIDS, WAF) to Log and Incident Management systems.
