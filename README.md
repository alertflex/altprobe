# Altprobe

Altprobe is a component of an Alertflex project, it has functional of a collector according to SIEM/Log Management terminologies. 
Based on the filtering policies, Altprobe extracts events with high priority from flows of data generated by IDS and makes for them aggregation 
and normalization. It allows to simplify alerts and incidents management, reduces noise from minor events. 

## Alertflex project
Alertflex is a network security monitoring project designed for use in Hybrid IT (traditional and cloud-based IT infrastructure). 
By monitoring security events from Host IDS OSSEC / Wazuh and Network IDS Suricata in real-time, Alertflex helps to detect network intrusions and malware 
on all network from the perimeter to the endpoints.

Alertflex may work as a stand-alone system or as part of a unified security solution. Alertflex provides security event management and 
services orchestration for open source security applications ( TheHive, Cuckoo Sandbox, MISP, Graylog ).
